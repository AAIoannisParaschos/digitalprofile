    <h2>Verizon App Challenge</h2>

      <div class="column2">
        <p>The Verizon App Challenge was a competition offered to students of in Grades 6-12. I competed in my ninth grade year with 6 others in my group; the other people in the group were: Lauren Burgess, Sydney Petiteau, McKinley Matthews, Gracen Kay, Nicklaus MacIlrath, and Rylan Pennington. Each group was presented with the challenge to develop an app concept and pitch it out with a video, but we took it a step further and began to code the app for use. Our idea was called "CPR Buddy," an app that assists users with basic CPR and walks them through the steps of different emergency situations. Our concept won best in the state and thus entered us into the national competitions of Verizon App Challenge. There were two competitions, one where we were professionally judged by officals, and one popularity-based, where we had to round up as many people as possible to vote our app best in the nation. For the professionally judged competition, we made it to regionals but did not move past that phase. For the popular-vote contest, we placed 21st out of the country. Our main focus when constructing the app was to make it as easy as possible for any person to help aid an emergency situation with CPR Buddy; the app helps by speaking the steps of CPR to a person, providing the proper pace when giving CPR, giving them the ability to call emergency services, locating locate the nearest police stations and hospitals, and instructions on how to handle other emergency situations such as such as strokes.</p> <!--talk about development of app, competition, where is it going in the future-->

        <p>For Tech Fair of my freshmen year, 5 members of the CPR Buddy Group (Yianni Paraschos (myself), Gracen Kay, Lauren Burgess, Sydney Petiteau, and Nicklaus MacIlrath) decided to re-enter the app we had developed previosuly. The Tech Fair project consisted of developing the app to a fuller and more usable extent and get the concept of the app out into the public. We won second place in the Gaming and App design section for high school students.</p>
