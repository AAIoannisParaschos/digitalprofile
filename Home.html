	  <p>Hi! My name is Ioannis Paraschos, also known as Yianni to everyone. I was born in Georgetown, South Carolina, but I've lived in Myrtle Beach for my entire life. Both sides of my family are of Greek origin, living only a few kilometers of eachother in Thessaloniki, Greece. Along with English, I can speak Greek fluently, learning more each day. I'm currently a high school junior attending the Academy for the Arts, Science, and Technology (also known as AAST). I've attended AAST since my ninth grade year; when I was a tenth grader, I chose to pursue the Computer Science Major offered at AAST and began taking its courses in my eleventh grade year. As I was in the school longer and longer, I began becoming more involved with AAST and the community of students around it. Currently, I'm one of the Junior Class Representatives of AAST and the President of AAST's National Beta Chapter. I'm also currently a swimmer on the Coastal Aquatic Club (also known as CAC) and aspiring to make Senior Sectionals by the end of my senior year. At AAST, I've been able to grow out of my shell and become a strong student leader willing to help everyone, growing more and more by the day. I keep myself involved with numerous clubs and extracurriculars and happily represent the student body to show that I am dedicated to each and every task that I take on.</p>
