    <p>National History Day is a worldwide competition based on an indvidual or group of students' research project. Every year, there is a theme that the students must abide by and base their projects around; the theme for my 8th grade year was "Exploration, Encounter, Exchange." Because Horry County limited topic choice to only South Carolina-related topics, we could not expand to topics outside of the United States unless they relayed back to South Carolina somehow. My partner and I then came to the consensus of choosing the legacy of Harvey Gantt and his impact on North and South Carolina. We proceeded to build a website under the National History Day Weebly website creator. The link to the finished site can be found <a href="https://68028220.nhd.weebly.com" target="_blank">here</a>. The competition isn't only the creation of a project; each group or individual is also judged on their presentation skills of their projects. My partner and I won the school competition in our catagory, and thus proceeded to move into the regional competition. Here at regionals was our first time truly presenting the project to people we weren't familiar with, so the pressure was high. We won first place in our catagory at regionals, which automatically sends us to the state competition. When we were there, we won first place out of our catagory, thus moving to the nationals aspect of the competition. The national competition was held in Washington DC, where we placed 11th overall in our catagory, going against people from all over the world, including places like South Korea and China.
